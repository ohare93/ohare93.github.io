#### In late February 2019 I moved from the UK :uk: to Denmark :denmark:

During this process I had to navigate a lot of bureaucracy with strange names in order to live in this unfamiliar system. This post is an attempt to give back some of the information I learned to others who have moved or will soon move to Denmark. The post is mostly an overview of all the unfamiliar bureaucratic applications and accounts one will come across in this transition, along with some miscellaneous tips, advice, and opinions.{% include margin.html content="All correct opinions" %}

I hope some of these quick overviews of the Danish government and public services will help others grasp them faster than I did! I will link to the relevant sites and helpful pages for each individual part, but more of it can be found on the following ICS page:

## CPR Number
`Central Person Registration Number` is the first and most important thing to apply for. It is used for most things in Denmark

> Residents of Denmark are legally required to have a CPR number. You will also notice that your CPR number allows you to access a range of services in Denmark. **You will need it to open a bank account, get a Danish phone number, borrow materials from the library, pay tax, receive salary, etc.**


A CPR# is 8 digits followed by 4 digits: the first are your birthday (25/01/1987 would be "25011987") and the last are a unique identifier.{% include margin.html content="Males CPR# end in an odd number and females end in an even" %}

:link: [General information about your CPR#][How to get a CPR number]

#### Helpful Info

You will need to fill out an online application for your CPR number, after which you will be asked to attend a meeting at the `International Citizen Service` at your local `International House`. For this application, and subsequent in person appointment, you may need the following documentation depending on your own circumstances:
 - Housing confirmation: rental contract, hotel receipt, etc{% include margin.html content="I simply had my wife sign a document saying 'I allow Jordan to live with me'" %}
 - Residence Permit: EU or non-EU variety
 - Identification: Passport or National Identification
 - Birth Certificate - `only for people under 18`
 - Marriage Certificate - `only for married couples`{% include margin.html content="It is also a good idea to have your partner come to the appointment with you" %}


Online Application for CPR Number: :link: [Copenhagen][CPR Number Application Copenhagen], :link: [Everywhere Else][CPR Number Application General]

You can find your local International House on the :link: [International Citizen Service page][International Citizen Service]. You can book an appointment online (:link: [Copenhagen Booking Page][State Admin Book Time]) but those are usually fully booked so it is best simply to go in during their opening times, take a number, and wait in line.

:exclamation: The International House is also where you should go in order to get help with the paperwork for a European Union Residence Permit, Tax Card, Foreign and Driving License, not just CPR numbers.

## NemID

TODO: NemID
 - Single login for Danish internet banks and government websites
 - Uses your CPR# as a login, along with your password, and a single use key
   - Key booklet can be replaced with an app
     - Link to app
     - App takes 1 hour to setup
 - Instruction for getting a NemID
   - Place to go, how to book it, what you need beforehand{% include margin.html content="They give you a temporary username and password" %}
   - Key booklet will be sent in the post and can take up to a week to arrive, after which you can change to the app
   - Can bring along a Danish partner who can sign some things and vouch for your identity, in order to get the booklet immediately 
   - Will need your passport for ID

Citizen Service Centre (aka 'Borgerservice')

After you have a CPR# you can get a NemID.



After you have received everything follow these steps to activate your NemID: https://www.nemid.nu/dk-en/get_started/activate_your_nemid/




:link: [Request a NemID][NemID get started]

:link: [Find a Citizen Service Centre close to your postcode][Find citizen service centres]

[NemID get started]: https://www.nemid.nu/dk-en/get_started/request_nemid/
[Find citizen service centres]: https://service.nemid.nu/dk-da/support/find_dit_borgerservicecenter/

### Nemkonto

When you are sent a payment from the public sector (for salary, tax refunds, student loans, welfare payments, etc) you need only give your CPR number. Then that payment will be sent to your default bank account: **your NemKonto** (aka an 'Easy Account').

In the future if you ever wish where these payments go then you simply change which account is the NemKonto in your online banking. No communication with each payment provider is necessary.

:link: [More info about NemKonto][NemKonto info]

[NemKonto info]: https://www.nemkonto.dk/da/Servicemenu/Engelsk

:bulb: Online banking in Danish can be extremely confusing, as most beginners of Danish do not know complicated bank terminology. I suggest you find the login page for the English version of your online banking and bookmark it. Here is the :link: [Danske Bank English login page][Danske Bank English Login].

### E-Boks

Everyone with a CPR number is given an E-Boks account, which is a digital mailbox associated to you. Usually people receive mail into their E-Boks from their bank, municipality, place of work, skat, etc.

You can choose to get email notifications to your personal email account whenever you have mail in your E-Boks. Each user can also store sensitive documents in their account, such as deeds, birth certificates, or insurance documents, up to a total of 1GB.

:link: [E-Boks login][E-Boks login]

## Skat 

Skat is the Danish Treasury in charge of all tax.{% include margin.html content="Skat also means \"treasure\", so don't get confused if you think people in Denmark call their loved ones \"Tax office\"" %}

You need to get a personal tax number and a tax card from Skat, in order to work or get a Danish bank account. You can do so from the following link:

:link: [Skat Tax Card Application][Skat Tax Card Application]


#### Helpful info

Opt-out of Church tax{% include margin.html content="If you want to" %}. It may be automatically done when you state your religion in one of the previous forms, but you may have to do it by manually submitting a ticket in the self service page.
TODO: Explain church tax first, and state the % paid. About 0.7% on average?

If you are you married you should tell Skat, as then you can get your partner's tax free allowance when they are not working.

Each year in January all working people in Denmark are required to review their tax to give Skat an up to date estimate of your earnings for the year. You should receive an email to your E-Boks in early January, with a personal review.

### Yellow Card

![Image](/assets/Moving-To-Denmark/yellow-health-card.png)
 - Your Danish Health card, associated with your CPR#
 - Essentially the Danish version of a "Blue Card" aka "European Health Insurance Card"
 - It has your doctors name/address/contact details on it, and you'll get a new one whenever you switch doctors

 :link: [General Information about Yellow Cards][Getting a Yellow Card]

 [Getting a Yellow Card]: https://international.kk.dk/healthcard

#### Doctors

All medical visits in Denmark (doctors, dentist, hospital visit, etc) require your physical Yellow Card. You usually sign in either by handing over your Yellow card, or by swiping/scanning it in a little machine at the front deck. This lets them know you have arrived for your appointment, and verifies your identity.

If you are prescribed medicine it is associated with your yellow card. Simply go to any pharmacy (take a ticket!) and they will ask for your yellow card so they can scan it and confirm you have a prescription waiting for you.

:link: [Email Consultation][EmailKonsultation.dk] is an easy way to get medical advice from your doctor, especially in non-emergency situations, simply by logging on and sending your doctor a message. The response time ranges from a few days to a week, in my experience. You cannot upload pictures, but you can link to them.

## Other Advice

### Work

  <iframe style="width:120px;height:240px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="//ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=GB&source=ss&ref=as_ss_li_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=jordanmunchoh-21&language=en_GB&marketplace=amazon&region=GB&placement=B077CRBVBZ&asins=B077CRBVBZ&linkId=e73dd4dad0f3d886adc009866f2af034&show_border=true&link_opens_in_new_window=true"></iframe>
</div>

I recommend the book [How to Work in Denmark][How to Work in Denmark Amazon] by Kay Xander Mellish. Here is a summary:

>With its high salaries and good work-life balance, Denmark is an attractive place to work for professionals from all over the world. But the Danish workplace, like Danish culture as a whole, is built on unwritten rules and unspoken expectations. "How to Work in Denmark" explains some of the rules of the road in the Danish workplace, as well as how to find and keep a job in Denmark.

A few Danish job search sites: :link: [Jobnet][Danish Job Search jobnet], :link: [JobsInCopenhagen][Danish Job Search jobsincopenhagen], :link: [WorkInDenmark][Danish Job Search workindenmark]. 

:bulb: Contact *Danish* recruiters on LinkedIn. If you do not know how to go about contacting Danish recruiters then consider asking any of your working professional friends/contacts in Denmark if they will post a small message to LinkedIn on your behalf. Just something small stating they have a friend looking for work, with some minimal contact information about you which will get lots of *Danish* recruiters to notice you.{% include margin.html content="Like sharks..." %}

When you get a job remember to note down your companies CVR#, as you will need to give it to Skat. A CVR number is just a CPR number but for companies, and tells Skat who you are working for for tax reasons.
TODO: Link to find a CVR page.

There are currently no paid holidays for the first year of your work, but :link: [this law is in the process of changing][New Danish Holiday Law].

TODO: Potentially join a Union and A-kasse?

TODO: Firiepenge?

### Danish Language Classes

TODO: Learning Danish
Government courses seem expensive and restrictive. They are also in the process of changing back to being free, idfk though. 

You will be sent a letter after you register for a CPR saying you have to register with a Danish Language Centre within 30days of this letter, otherwise you will lose your entitlement to Government courses. You can register with them and say they will not take any lessons at that time, and instead go with a private school.

Consider a private school. TODO: link to Studieskolen.



### Miscellaneous

TODO: Miscellaneous stuff

:exclamation: :exclamation: :exclamation: **Get your name on your mailbox!**  This is the most important piece of advice on this page, and you should do it as soon as you can. This is because for any communication with the government, or delivery in the mail of any of the below documentation, it requires that your name is on the postbox for verification that it is being sent to the right person. Otherwise for hotels and such I believe it is sometimes possible to send it to the proprieter, and have them hand deliver it to you.

Change your phone's default to +45

Useful words to learn
 - "Afmeld" is "unsubscribe" for spam emails

<div style="float:right">
  <iframe style="width:120px;height:240px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="//ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=GB&source=ss&ref=as_ss_li_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=jordanmunchoh-21&language=en_GB&marketplace=amazon&region=GB&placement=B0722GJNNT&asins=B0722GJNNT&linkId=776e555d541e19e71db0dad704667441&show_border=true&link_opens_in_new_window=true"></iframe>

Living in Copenhagen
 - Rejsekort is useful

Getting Married in Denmark? Bring along:
 - Birth Certificate
 - Certificate of No Impediment
 - Costs 1000kr-ish?


Moving to Denmark with Pets
 - Make sure you are covered by [the local laws][Importing Pets to Denmark]

Library
 - [Bibliotek.dk][Bibliotek]

Learn the name of your own country in Danish. "Storbritannien" never would have occured to me, and was hard to find in a dropdown list!
