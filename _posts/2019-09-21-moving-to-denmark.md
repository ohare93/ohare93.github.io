# Goal

TODO: Introduction

#### In late February 2019 I moved from the UK :uk: to Denmark :denmark:

During this process I had to navigate a lot of bureaucracy and learn to navigate and live in an unfamiliar system. This post is an attempt to give back some of that information to others, in the hopes that their move is smoother and less confusing than my own.

This post contains:
 - Clarifications about unfamiliar terms{% include margin.html content="CPR, Skat, NemID, E-Boks, Yellow Card, etc" %}
 - Necessary bureaucratic tasks I had to do along the way
 - A few tips I wish I had known ahead of time
 - Some opinions!{% include margin.html content="An unspecified amount" %}


TODO: State the order things have to happen in

Things not covered in this page:
 - How a non-eu citizen emigrates to Denmark
 - How to find a place to live

# Living

## Work
TODO: Job stuff

 - Currently no paid holidays for the first year, but it is in the process of changing [Helpful Page Link][New Danish Holiday Law]
 - Note down your companies CVR#, as you will need to give it to Skat
   - CVR numbers are just CPR numbers but for companies, and tell Skat who you are working for for tax reasons
 - Potentially join a Union and A-kasse
 - Recommend the book How to Work in Denmark
 - Finding a job advice:
   - Contact Danish recruiters on LinkedIn. If you know others working professionals in Denmark, as them to post a small message stating they have a friend looking for work, with some minimal information. This will get lots of recruiters to notice you.

#### General Overview

| CPR# | The "Central Person Registration Number" is the unique identifying number used to connect you to official documents and websites |
| NemID | Single login for Danish internet banks and government websites -- your CPR number is your password |
| E&#8209;Boks | Your online inbox for official mail (banks/tax/etc) |
| Skat | The government tax office / treasury -- they are who you will be paying tax to {% include margin.html content="Skat also means \"treasure\", so don't get confused if you think people in Denmark call their loved ones \"Tax office\"" %} | 
| Yellow Card | Your Danish National Health Insurance card, used for all medical appointments |




I got most of my information from this [International Citizen Service "Moving to Denmark?" webpage][International Citizen Service]


```
Step 1: Apply for a personal registration number (CPR) online
Step 2: Apply for an EU residence document
Step 3: Collect your CPR-number at your nearest ICS
Step 4: Apply for a tax card
```


## CPR Number
`Central Person Registration Number` is the first and most important thing to get. It is used for most things in Denmark

> Residents of Denmark are legally required to have a CPR number. You will also notice that your CPR number allows you to access a range of services in Denmark. **You will need it to open a bank account, get a Danish phone number, borrow materials from the library, pay tax, receive salary, etc.**


A CPR# is 8 digits followed by 4 digits: the first are your birthday (25/01/1987 would be "25011987") and the last are a unique identifier. {% include margin.html content="Males CPR# end in an odd # and females end in an even" %}

### Yellow Card
![Image](/assets/Moving-To-Denmark/yellow-health-card.png)
 - Your Danish Health card, associated with your CPR#.
 - Essentially the Danish version of a "Blue Card" aka "European Health Insurance Card"
 - It has your doctors name/address/contact details on it, and you'll get a new one whenever you switch doctors.

 :link: [General Information about Yellow Cards][Getting a Yellow Card]

 [Getting a Yellow Card]: https://international.kk.dk/healthcard

#### Doctors
 - Going to the Doctors / Pharmacy
   - Sign into the doctors by swiping your yellow card. This lets them know you have arrived for your appointment, and verifies your identity.
   - If you are prescribed medicine it is associated with your yellow card. Simply go to the pharmacy (take a ticket!) and they will ask for your yellow card so they can scan it and confirm you have some prescriptions waiting for you
 - [Email Consultation][EmailKonsultation.dk] is a good way to get medical advice from your doctor, simply by loggin on and sending them a message. You cannot upload pictures, but you can link to them.




TODO: EU Residence Document
 - What it is
 - How to do it
 - Register for [meeting online][State Admin Book Time], but it's usually filled up so just show up in person (TODO: Location of "State Administration")

[State Admin Book Time]: https://kk.reservertid.nu/Time/1057?pid=1113


TODO: Skat
Get a Tax card from SKAT
 - What it is and how to get it
 - You may hear people call their loved ones "Skat". That is because Skat means "Treasure" and the SKAT branch of the Government are the "Treasury"
 - Opt-out of Church tax. It may be automatically done when you state your religion, but you may automatically have to do it by submitting a ticket in the self service page.
 - Are you married? Tell Skat, as then you can get your partner's tax free allowance when they are not working

# Danish Language Classes

TODO: Learning Danish
Government courses seem expensive and restrictive
 - You will be sent a letter after you register for a CPR saying you have to register with a Danish Language Centre within 30days of this letter, otherwise you will lose your entitlement to Government courses. You can register with them and say they will not take any lessons at that time, and instead go with a private school.

 - Private schools are great

 - Private lessons online
 - Immersion Courses
 - Have a Danish partner

Useful words to learn
 - "Afmeld" is "unsubscribe" for spam emails

You are just starting in a new country, this is a fresh opportunity to start budgetting!
