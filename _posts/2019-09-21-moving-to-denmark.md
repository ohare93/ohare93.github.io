# Goal

TODO: Introduction

To share my own experiences on the process of moving to Denmark. 




State the order things have to happen in.


# Living

## Work
TODO: Job stuff

 - Currently no paid holidays for the first year, but it is in the process of changing [Helpful Page Link][New Danish Holiday Law]
 - Note down your companies CVR#, as you will need to give it to Skat
   - CVR numbers are just CPR numbers but for companies, and tell Skat who you are working for for tax reasons
 - Potentially join a Union and A-kasse
 - Recommend the book How to Work in Denmark
 - Finding a job advice:
   - Contact Danish recruiters on LinkedIn. If you know others working professionals in Denmark, as them to post a small message stating they have a friend looking for work, with some minimal information. This will get lots of recruiters to notice you.

## Home
TODO: Finding a home

 - Get your name on your mailbox


# Bureaucracy


I got most of my information from this [International Citizen Service "Moving to Denmark?" webpage][International Citizen Service]


```
Step 1: Apply for a personal registration number (CPR) online
Step 2: Apply for an EU residence document
Step 3: Collect your CPR-number at your nearest ICS
Step 4: Apply for a tax card
```


TODO: CPR Number
 - What it is
 - How to do so
 - Central Person Registration Number

Online Application for CPR Number if you will live in Copenhagen. [Link][CPR Number Application Copenhagen]


TODO: EU Residence Document
 - What it is
 - How to do it
 - Register for [meeting online][State Admin Book Time], but it's usually filled up so just show up in person (TODO: Location of "State Administration")

[State Admin Book Time]: https://kk.reservertid.nu/Time/1057?pid=1113


TODO: Skat
Get a Tax card from SKAT
 - What it is and how to get it
 - You may hear people call their loved ones "Skat". That is because Skat means "Treasure" and the SKAT branch of the Government are the "Treasury"
 - Opt-out of Church tax. It may be automatically done when you state your religion, but you may automatically have to do it by submitting a ticket in the self service page.
 - Are you married? Tell Skat, as then you can get your partner's tax free allowance when they are not working

TODO: NemID
 - Single login for Danish internet banks and government websites
 - Uses your CPR# as a login, along with your password, and a single use key
   - Key booklet can be replaced with an app
     - Link to app
     - App takes 1 hour to setup
 - Instruction for getting a NemID
   - Place to go, how to book it, what you need beforehand
   - They give you a temporary username and password.
   - Key booklet will be sent in the post and can take up to a week to arrive, after which you can change to the app
   - Can bring along a Danish partner who can sign some things and vouch for your identity, in order to get the booklet immediately 
   - Will need your passport for ID


TODO: Bank Account
 - NemKonto is your default bank account that money comes out of from transactions associated with your NemID
 - Find the link to the English version of the website and bookmark it
   - [Danske Bank English Login][Danske Bank English Login]

TODO: E-Boks
 - Mail account for Bank/Tax/Work

TODO: Yellow Card
 - Your Danish Health card, associated with your CPR#.
 - Essentially the Danish version of a "Blue Card" aka "European Health Insurance Card"
 - Going to the Doctors / Pharmacy
   - Sign into the doctors by swiping your yellow card. This lets them know you have arrived for your appointment, and verifies your identity.
   - If you are prescribed medicine it is associated with your yellow card. Simply go to the pharmacy (take a ticket!) and they will ask for your yellow card so they can scan it and confirm you have some prescriptions waiting for you
 - [Email Consultation][EmailKonsultation.dk] is a good way to get medical advice from your doctor, simply by loggin on and sending them a message. You cannot upload pictures, but you can link to them.

# Danish Language Classes

TODO: Learning Danish
Government courses seem expensive and restrictive
- You will be sent a letter after you register for a CPR saying you have to register with a Danish Language Centre within 30days of this letter, otherwise you will lose your entitlement to Government courses. You can register with them and say they will not take any lessons at that time, and instead go with a private school.

Private schools are great

Private lessons online
Immersion Courses
Have a Danish partner


# Misc

TODO: Miscellaneous stuff
Change your phone's default to +45

Useful words to learn
 - "Afmeld" is "unsubscribe" for spam emails

You are just starting in a new country, this is a fresh opportunity to start budgetting!

Living in Copenhagen
 - Rejsekort is useful



Getting Married in Denmark? Bring along:
 - Birth Certificate
 - Certificate of No Impediment
 - Costs 1000kr-ish?


Moving to Denmark with Pets
 - Make sure you are covered by [the local laws][Importing Pets to Denmark]
