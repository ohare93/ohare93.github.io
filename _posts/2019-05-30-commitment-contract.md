I have created these Commitment Contracts on [Beeminder][Beeminder] :bee: for things I do not do often enough, but want to do more in my life.

For each task I have set an average amount I must complete each week (shown below). The time shown below each graph is **the time until failure**. When that time draws near Beeminder will notify me to get my shit together.

For example: ~~When~~ If I fail then Beeminder will **_Charge My Bank Account $1_** :dollar: then next time I fail it will be $2. Though I have mine set to $0 initially, while I get used to the system.
