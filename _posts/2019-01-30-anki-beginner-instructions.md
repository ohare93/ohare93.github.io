This guide assumes you already *want* to begin using a Spaced Repetition System (SRS) to retain knowledge and assist in learning. `"But how do I begin?"` or `"What does this terminology mean?"` This guide will cover the basics of setting up Anki, as well as some common terminology and use cases.

## Download Anki
Download and install __[Anki]__.

When installed it should look like this:

### Importing a Deck

Visit the [Anki Shared Decks][AnkiSharedDecks] page to see decks people have created and shared. Find a deck you want to try, using the categories to help, or just by searching by name.

[![Image](/assets/anki-examples/search-for-deck.png){: style="border: 1px solid black;"}][AnkiSharedDecks]

You can download and import these decks into your Anki, then change the decks however you want. If the author makes a change to the original deck yours will not change, but you can usually redownload the updated version and apply the changes without impacting your study progress.

Let's take this deck on the [NATO Phonetic Alphabet][NatoDeck] as our example.

[![Image](/assets/anki-examples/nato-deck-page.png){: style="border: 1px solid black;"}][NatoDeck]

Download^ the deck, and open the `.apkg` package. It will open Anki, saying it has imported. Like this:

## Study 
Now you have a deck of flashcards, and can begin studying! Simply click on a deck, and click the `Study Now` button.

# Studying new cards

You'll be shown the front of a **card** in the deck.

![Image](/assets/anki-examples/nato-front.png)

Hit `Show Answer` to view the back of the card, with the answer. **Remember** your goal is to *recall* the information on the back of the card *before* looking.

![Image](/assets/anki-examples/nato-back.png)

You are given three choices *when learning new cards*: `Again`, `Good`, and `Easy`. The time above these options states how long it will be until you see this card again. For new cards this is called the "Learning Step". Selecting `Good` will push the review 10mins away, `Easy` 4days, and `Again` 1min. 

If you know the and you found the question easy, then select `Easy`, and Anki will make sure to schedule this card further in the future from now on. If you were just correct select `Good`, and if you were wrong selcet `Again`. These options help Anki better tune specific cards to ask for review at the optimum time for learning.

Cards are also shown in a random order by default, so you do not simply recall the order.

# Studying learned cards

![Image](/assets/anki-examples/nato-back-learned-cards.png)

You will get four choices *when reviewing learned cards*: `Again`, `Hard`, `Good`, and `Easy`. The last two act the same as for learning new cards, `Again` is slightly differently, and `Hard` is only an option for learned cards.

When you select `Again` for a card you had previously learned, that means the card has *lapsed*. You once knew it, and no longer do. It will go from being a "learned" card to a "(re)learning" card. Anki will show this card more frequently in the future.

Select `Hard` when you knew the answer, but it was very difficult to recall (perhaps you initially thought of a wrong answer). The card will get only a slightly longer delay than the last period.

E.g. 1d -> 3d -> 8d -> 20d -> 50d.

### Browse Cards in a Deck

If you can't see the sidebar, then in the  hit `Go -> Sidebar` to bring it up.

>The sidebar on the left allows quick access to common search terms. Various search terms as described below are listed, along with all deck names and tag names. Clicking on an item will search for it.

### Notes vs Cards

Users input Notes into Anki, which then takes a Note and generates some Card(s).

---

## Stats

![Image](/assets/anki-examples/stats.png){:height="600em" width="200em" style="float: right;  padding-right:1em"}

Stats can be found by clicking `Stats` in the main window of Anki.
![Image](/assets/anki-examples/stats2.png){: height="350em" width="500em" style="border: 1px solid black;"}

### Card States

As shown in the stat above, cards have different states: `Unseen`, `Learning`, `Young`, `Mature`, `Suspended` and `Buried`. 

---

## AnkiWeb Syncing

Make an account on __[AnkiWeb]__. Then click `Sync` in the main window of Anki, in the top bar at the right.


## Advanced Functionality Roundup

Here I'll quickly touch on some more advanced functionality of Anki.

### Card Intervals
As entioned in [#Study](#study) the period of a card is changed to be closer or further away when you select `Easy` or `Hard` (also for `Again` for learned cards). This is because these options change the card's *Ease Factor* which starts at 250%. When you mark a card as correct, it's new interval is calculated by the formula: `Current Interval x Ease Factor x Deck Interval Modifier`. Which is usually something like: `2d x 250% x 100%` = 5d.

*Current Interval* is the current period of the card, how long since your last review of it. 

*Ease Factor* is how easy the card is, the higher the % the easier it is. When you select `Hard` during a review, Anki first lowers the card's *Ease Factor* by some % *then* calculates the next interval. Same with `Easy`, but it increases the *Ease Factor*. This change to the *Ease Factor* is permanent, and so it will affect all future reviews of this card, making them longer or shorter.

*Deck Interval Modifier* is set in the Deck options, and will simply change each card's interval by its value. If you want to see every card in the deck more often then decrease it, and the opposite to see all cards less often.

### [Burying][AnkiManualSiblings]

[*Burying*] is done by Anki automatically, in an effort to not show *Siblings* (Cards which are generated from the same Note). This is because they will most likely share some information, and therefore impact of the later shown cards may be hurt by reviewing the first. *Burying* a card means to put it back ontop of the deck for tomorrow, essentially delaying the review.

### [Suspending & Leeches][AnkiManualLeeches]

Anki tracks how many times each card has *lapsed* (where it was learned, and then was forgotten). If the number of lapses gets above a threshold (default: 8 times) then Anki marks this card as a Leech. The default behaviour is to automatically tag the card with `Leech` and then *Suspend* the card, which means the card will never show up in a review again, until you unsuspend it. 

You can also manually Suspend a card (or an entire note) through the options menu.



### [Extensions/Add-ons][AnkiAddons]

Anki is open source, and has great support for Extensions, which you can view [here][AnkiAddons].

To install an extension go into the Extension's page and find the download code.

![Image](/assets/anki-examples/extention-download.png){: style="border: 1px solid black;"}

Copy this code, then in the Anki main window click `Tools -> Add-ons -> Get Add-ons` type the code in the box, and hit `OK`. The Extension will install, and require a reboot of Anki to function.

### Missing Reviews
### Optimum Recall?
### [Profiles for Multiple Users][AnkiManualProfiles]

`File -> Switch Profile`

>Profiles are intended to be used by different people, and each AnkiWeb account can only keep one profile in sync. For dividing up your own content, you should use separate decks rather than separate profiles, except when using extra profiles for experimenting with changes you donâ€™t plan to sync to other devices.

Very useful for multiple people using the same computer, as you'll each have your own account to sign into, and sync progress to.
