### Importing a Deck

Visit the [Anki Shared Decks][AnkiSharedDecks] page to see decks people have shared, which you can download and import.

Find a deck you want to try. Let's take this deck on the [NATO Phonetic Alphabet][NatoDeck] as our example.

Download the deck, and open the `.apkg` package. It should open Anki, saying it has imported. Like this:

### Browse Cards in a Deck

If you can't see the sidebar, then in the  hit `Go -> Sidebar` to bring it up.

>The sidebar on the left allows quick access to common search terms. Various search terms as described below are listed, along with all deck names and tag names. Clicking on an item will search for it.
