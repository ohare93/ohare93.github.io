I have created an Anki Flashcard deck for [WebDiplomacy.net][WebDiplomacy] in order to help ~~myself~~ people remember the territory names :world_map:

Haven't ever used Anki before? Have a look at this [Anki Beginner Steps][AnkiBeginnerSteps] page, which may help :+1:


## [- -> Deck Download Link <- -][DiplomacyDeck]

The deck currently only covers the Classic map, but I can add the [other variant maps][WebDiplomacyMapVariants] easily enough if there's any interest.

### Preview

On the front of the card you see all the territories, with one blanked out by a square.

On the back the covered one is revealed. There is one card for each territory. Simple stuff.

The cards were made using the lovely [Image Occlusion Enhanced Add-on][ImageOcclusionEnhanced] (the 2.1 version currently available on his [Patreon][GlutanimatePatreon]).

## Hardcore Deck

Do you want a more challenging version of the deck, where no other countries are shown? Look no further:

## [- -> Hardcore Deck Download Link <- -][HardcodeDeck]

The red/orange one is the one being asked, and all territories are colour coded: blue for water, green for SCs, and grey for non-SCs.

Then on the other side it is shown, while the rest remain hidden. You can always choose to view them all here using the "Toggle Masks" button on the bottom.
