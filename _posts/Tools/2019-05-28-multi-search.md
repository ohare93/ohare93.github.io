This tool will open a new tab for each new line in the text box, for each site below.

<div style='background-color:lightgrey'>

#### Brief explanation
This is my *Danish Multi-Search Tool*, which I use to facilitate quick creation of flashcards for my Danish studies. When I have a word or a phrase I wish to learn there are many things I can need: `translation`; `image`; `audio`; `conjugation`. Using this tool I can input all the words and open all the tabs of a specific kind at once, taking what I need from each, and closing each tab when I am done. This has been much more efficient for me than looking up the next word each time.
