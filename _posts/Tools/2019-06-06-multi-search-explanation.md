#### Brief explanation

This is my *Danish Multi-Search Tool*, which I use to facilitate quick creation of flashcards for my Danish studies. When I have words/phrases/sentences I wish to learn there are many things I can need: `translation`; `image`; `audio`; `conjugation`. Using this tool I can input all the desires phrases at once and open all the tabs of a specific kind; taking what I need from each and closing the tab when I am done. This has been much more efficient for me than looking up the next word each time.

#### How does it work?

There are a few sites I frequent whenever I am studying Danish: [Forvo][Forvo], [Google Image][GoogleImage], [Ordnet][Ordnet], and [Verbix][Verbix], sometimes [Babla][Babla], and [Google Translate][GoogleTranslateDA-EN].
<!-- Add Sites I visit, with explanations about each -->

It takes a word / phrase / sentence from each line (ignoring empty lines) and then opens the appropriate page.

#### Potential Issues

You may have to allow your browser to open multiple tabs at once, the first time.
